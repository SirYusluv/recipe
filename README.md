[![Project image](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a00fef7b-94d8-41b3-92d8-9b2c2ac7b46a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/recipeee-app/deploys)

Site hoted on ["recipe"](https://recipeee-app.netlify.app/#5ed6604591c37cdc054bcaf5 "Carefully developed by SirYusluv") on netlify.

Site should be open on a desktop as its is not responsive, might consider making it responsive but not now.

There are some animation glitch on chrome

## Some features used:

- React features like Context API, React Hooks
- React Portal
- Custom Hooks
- CheckBox Hack (HTML CSS for **click listener** instead of JS)
- And some others...
